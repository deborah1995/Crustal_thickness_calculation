# Crustal Thickness Calculation
This repository contains a Python script to calculate the crustal thickness using the data from: Juan Carlos Afonso, Farshad Salajegheh, Wolfgang Szwillus, Jorg Ebbing, Carmen Gaina, A global reference model of the lithosphere and upper mantle from joint inversion and analysis of multiple data sets, Geophysical Journal International, Volume 217, Issue 3, June 2019, Pages 1602â€“1628, https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz094.
The crustal thickness is calculated by subtracting the depth of the Moho discontinuity from the surface elevation at specified geographic coordinates or for an entire dataset.
