# Crustal Thickness Calculation Using LithoRef18 Dataset

This repository contains a Python script to calculate the crustal thickness using the LithoRef18 dataset. The crustal thickness is calculated by subtracting the depth of the Moho discontinuity (from the LithoRef18 model) from the surface elevation at specified geographic coordinates or for an entire dataset.
