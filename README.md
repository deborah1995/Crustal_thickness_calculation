# Crustal and Lithispheric Thickness Calculation
This repository contains a Python script to calculate the crustal thickness using the data from: Juan Carlos Afonso, Farshad Salajegheh, Wolfgang Szwillus, Jorg Ebbing, Carmen Gaina, A global reference model of the lithosphere and upper mantle from joint inversion and analysis of multiple data sets, Geophysical Journal International, Volume 217, Issue 3, June 2019, Pages 1602â€“1628, https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz094.
The crustal thickness is calculated as the distance between the Earth's surface (elevation) and the depth of the Moho discontinuity. This is achieved by subtracting the Moho depth (negative value relative to sea level) from the surface elevation at specified geographic coordinates or for an entire dataset.
To calculate the lithospheric thickness at specific geographic coordinates, the values of elevation and LAB at the specified coordinates were obtained using bilinear interpolation from the dataset grid points. The lithospheric thickness was then computed as the difference between the LAB depth and the surface elevation.
